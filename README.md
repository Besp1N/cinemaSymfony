# Cinema Project

Welcome to our Symfony-powered cinema application! This feature-rich platform combines Symfony and JavaScript to deliver an immersive movie-going experience. Users can explore a diverse movie catalog with the search functionality, reserve seats for upcoming screenings, and create accounts for a personalized journey through the world of cinema. Account activation is facilitated through a confirmation email sent using the integrated mailer.

The application utilizes a MySQL database to store crucial information, including user data, movie details, and reservation records. A dynamic map feature showcases the geographical locations of cinemas, providing users with a visual representation based on the movie localization property.
